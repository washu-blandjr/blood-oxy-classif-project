waveform file,signal name,sampling rate,description,usage notes
base,ECG-II,100 or 250 Hz,Represents the voltage between 2 ECG electrodes on the patient’s skin. Usually the most reliable source of heart rate.,
base,ETO2,100 or 250 Hz,Continuous measure of the partial pressure of oxygen at the mouthpiece in mmHg.,
base,ETCO2,100 or 250 Hz,Continuous measure of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the mouthpiece in mmHg.,
base,RR,100 or 250 Hz,"Respiratory rate is derived from the ETCO2 wave, assuming that peaks in the CO2 value correspond to the end of the exhalation.",
base,ART,100 or 250 Hz,ART is an invasive measurement of blood pressure taken at the arterial line in mmHg.,
ppg,RED,86,"Represents the RED (660nm) light attenuated by each of the colors of light used for pulse oximetry. In this archive the PPG signal is recorded as an 86hz 19-bit integer and scaled so that the light finger returns about 32,000 counts.",nb: the sampling rate is likely to change to 250Hz in future releases and will be integrated into the base file
ppg,IR,86,"Represents the INFRARED (905nm) light attenuated by each of the colors of light used for pulse oximetry. In this archive the PPG signal is recorded as an 86hz 19-bit integer and scaled so that the light finger returns about 32,000 counts.",nb: the sampling rate is likely to change to 250Hz in future releases and will be integrated into the base file
