# blood-oxy-classif-project

## Useful tools
### ML algorithm (from https://github.com/SamEGil00/CSE-454) to work with relevant data. Make sure to edit for this project's purposes 

## Plan of action (Delete after completion):
### First Half
1. Ensure data from excel loads in
2. Determine distributions for patient data (make a method to find train/test based on race categories). If time allows, can vary based on melanin level
3. Determine if there is an inaccuracy in existent bias and check as population distribution changes. Apply rigorous statistical methods to test our outputs
### Second Half
4. Implement ML Algorithm from Sam's class project. If too diffficult/time-consuming, we can apply ML from class. Our goal is to see how accurate values for each
5. Apply rigorous statistical methods to test our outputs

Hopefully by Saturday we are all done and spend the evening/rest of Sunday crafting the presentation for Monday.
